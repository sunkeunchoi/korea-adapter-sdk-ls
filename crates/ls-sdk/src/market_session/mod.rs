//! Market-session dependency class — `t1102` current-price (시세) quote.
//!
//! This is the *market_session* class: market-data queries scoped to a trading
//! session, credentialed but with no account state and — for `t1102` —
//! structurally **non-paginated**. The LS `t1102` TR (주식현재가(시세)조회)
//! returns a single snapshot quote for one symbol, so there is no continuation
//! to thread and no `HasPagination` impl: dispatch is a plain
//! [`ls_core::Inner::post`].
//!
//! ## Wire-compat: string-or-number coercion
//!
//! The LS gateway is inconsistent about whether numeric quote fields arrive as
//! JSON numbers (`"price": 4535`) or JSON strings (`"price": "4535"`) — the
//! captured spec example shows `price`/`volume` as bare numbers while `sign`
//! arrives as a string. Every numeric-bearing field therefore uses
//! [`ls_core::string_or_number`] so both shapes deserialize to the same `String`
//! without a panic. This is the load-bearing behavior R10 preserves; the
//! `market_session_tests` regression pins it against the spec-derived shape.
//!
//! ## No `tr_cont`/`tr_cont_key` in the body — by construction
//!
//! Because `t1102` is not paginated, the request carries NO continuation fields
//! at all. [`T1102Request`] serializes to exactly `{"t1102InBlock":{...}}`, so
//! the continuation tokens can never leak into the request body.
