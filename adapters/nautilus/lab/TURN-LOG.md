# Strategy-loop turn log

Committed record of each loop turn's verdict + the bar conditions it held. The
full artifacts (`analysis.md`, manifests, performance) live in the gitignored data
home; this file is the durable, reviewable outcome trail.

## Turn 3 — broaden-sample data turn (2026-07-07) — plan 2026-07-07-003

- **Verdict: insufficient-evidence.** The pre-registered R1 decisiveness bar was not cleared.
- **Type:** pure data turn — v3 params held exactly (`gap_min_pct = 0.6`, `strategy_version = 3`); zero param diff.
- **Sample:** 20 KOSPI top-market-cap names (frozen `t1444` capture, upcode 001, `lab/config/turn3-universe.json`) over 28 sessions `2026-05-26..2026-07-03`, fresh data home, daily + 1-minute bars (all 20 symbols, `catalog status` GO, no front-truncation).
- **Result:** 6 realized trades across 6 distinct symbols (1 each); `pnl_total` +320,000 KRW (Profit Factor 1.85).
- **R1 bar (computed, not eyeballed):**
  - (a) trade-count floor (≥ 30): **6 → FAIL**
  - (b) symbol-breadth floor (≥ 6 symbols each ≥ 2 trades): **0 → FAIL**
  - (c) single-symbol dominance (≤ 40% of aggregate |P&L|): **33.7% → PASS**
- **Reproducibility:** data-mode `runs compare` PASS ("no data deltas") vs an identical v3-wide rerun — determinism confirmed; run manifest carries `gap_min_pct = 0.6` / `strategy_version = 3` (v3 identity, KTD-3/KTD-5).
- **Bar integrity (R3):** the bar was fixed in the plan before the run and was not adjusted to the result.
- **Next (deferred):** the param turn lowering `gap_min_pct` from 0.6 toward ~0.3 (governed relative-change step within the 0.5 bounds cap) to admit more sessions, and/or a deeper/wider sample. Do not tune against this 6-trade sample.
- **Provenance:** run `20260707T075947Z-backtest-orb-v3` (fresh home `data/turn3`, gitignored).

### Context — turn 2 (prior)

v3 (`gap_min_pct = 0.6`) was the first floor to admit a fill: 1 trade on `005930` over a 12-session pinned range → verdict insufficient-evidence at n=1. Turn 3 broadened the sample to move the verdict off "insufficient by construction"; the broadened read still misses the trade-count and breadth floors, so the class holds — but now as a measured result, not an n=1 artifact.
